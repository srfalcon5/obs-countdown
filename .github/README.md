## Installing
1. Create a Text source element and position it for where you want the countdown timer.
2. Select Tools -> Scripts -> Add -> `countdown.lua` to add the script.
3. Adust the start time to you needs— the default is when the Falcon 5 is scheduled to run.
4. Set the text source to the Text source element you made in step 1.
5. Adjust the final text to your liking— the default is what is used for the Falcon 5.
